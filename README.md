# Powder Hound
Powder Hound is a snow weather app for, currently, four major ski resorts surrounding Seattle.  PH gives the upcoming snow report for today and the next three days. Users need to sign up and log in to use the site, but once they do they can see predicted snowfall as well as post photos and comments to each resorts weather page.

## User Story
Powder Hound is an app for the resort skier looking for the basics. Is it going to snow and how much.
The user then can spray about there day to either the weather page for that resort or the weather pages of the other resort. If the spray was to bold, their comment can be edited as well as the entire post being deleted.
